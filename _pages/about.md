About me
------
I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Psychology Department](https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/psychology/) at Connecticut College. In 2025, I earned my PhD in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychology.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. My PhD concentration is [Ecological Psychology](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/ecological-psychology/)—the study of biological perception, action, and cognition from the fundamental assumption of organism-environment mutuality. Throughout my graduate career, I was a research assistant in the [dyscord lab](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/), advised by [Dr. Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com/). Additionally, I my research program was housed within the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/) and the [Social-Ecological & Environmental Lab](https://seelab.socialpsych.uconn.edu/).  

**Research Interests**  
I use nonlinear methods to study interpersonal dynamics, with an interest in group synchrony and social connectedness. My work explores how synchronizing with others impacts physiological and self-reported health outcomes in various settings.  
<br/>Currently, I study this in the context of yoga and mindfulness practices. As a graduate affiliate of the [Experimental Anthropology Lab](https://www.experimentalanthropology.com/), I also led a related research project in Mauritius in 2022. There, we collected self-reported and physiological data during religious rituals.  
<br/>Overall, I believe it is essential that I ground my scientific questions and findings in the local community. Through my research, I aim to advocate for more widely accessible group yoga and mindfulness interventions in order to bolster social connectivity and improve wellbeing.  

**Personal Interests**  
My most joyous and fulfilling moments often occur while I'm practicing and teaching yoga, running outdoors, going to the gym, making music, and connecting with people. I completed 200 hours of yoga teacher training in 2018. Since then, I have taught yoga in a variety of settings, including at the beach, fitness centers, yoga studios, and virtually. As a yoga teacher and more broadly as an educator, I have a passion for inspiring people to learn and evolve.
