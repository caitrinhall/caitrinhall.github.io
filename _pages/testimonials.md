"I have really enjoyed this course. While the content is definitely interesting, what has had the most impact on me is the way the material is taught and discussed and the way the classroom environment is such a <b>safe space</b>. I especially appreciate the <b>openness</b> about ADHD, which makes me feel as though I don’t have to be ashamed or embarrassed about myself. Honestly, I would take any other course with Professor Hall, even if on paper it is not a subject I am typically interested in because I know she would make it <b>interesting</b> and <b>engaging</b>!"

"I really <b>enjoyed</b> taking this class! I had a lot of fun and all of the work we did was <b>very helpful</b> to get acclimated. I feel like this class helped me put the next four years in perspective for me and helped me feel <b>more confident</b>! I just want to say thank you to both Professor Hall and TA Christina for all of the hard work you guys put into this class and for making me feel <b>more welcome</b> on campus. Both of you guys <b>inspired</b> me to become a mentor for next year and I’m very excited to make others feel welcome like you guys did for me.”
